# CS2PA Tutorial Instructions:

Each tutorial has a designated directory with a markdown (.md) file to walk you through the exercises. The .md files are designed to be readable in a text editor or a browser.

Each tutorial directory also includes a 'help' and 'results' directory, these contain files to refer to when you get stuck and pre-calcualted results for the exercises if they are taking a long time to complete on the cluster.

Try as far as possible to solve the problems without the help, at least initially to engage with the problem and build your understanding of the various settings in the files.
